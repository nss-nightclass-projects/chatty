# Slack Clone Group Project
Your group will be creating a Slack clone. The features your team will build have already been added to your backlog in the "projects" section of this repo. This application should demonstrate your skills in:
- React JS
- Firebase
- Asynchronous code
- User Specific Data
- Debugging

## Requirements
* Clean code - Single Responsibility Principle!
* Balanced GitHub Contributions
* Completely planned out. Must fully complete milestones before moving to another.
* SASS and Bootstrap for Styling
* No errors - linters should be clean

## Interacting With Your Product Owner
Your group has been designated a product owner (one of the instructors). This product owner has the overall vision of the application and must approve your tickets before you start working on them. When you complete the MVP tickets in your backlog, you should reach out to your product owner to recieve tickets for additional features. Note that this project is often used as a portfolio project for students, so you and your team should push yourselves to get to the "game changer" bonus features, but only after you have a strong MVP.


Check out the [simple wireframe](https://app.moqups.com/chortlehoort/uGBbLbK46Y/view/page/a3bd0c733) for this application on Moqups.com. You can make your final interface as fancy as you like, but keep the general layout similar to the wireframe.
